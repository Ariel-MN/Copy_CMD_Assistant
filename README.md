# Copy_CMD_Assistant
CMD Script that helps to copy files in Windows by distributing them in different folders generated according to a specified size.

The utility of this script is to copy all the files from a specific directory and its subdirectories to a second given directory, separating the files into folders of a specific dimension without compromising the integrity of the files or cutting them.

### How?

After copying each file it renames it to avoid being overwritten in case more files share the same name in other subdirectories and it is also able to deal with file names that use spaces or other special characters.
